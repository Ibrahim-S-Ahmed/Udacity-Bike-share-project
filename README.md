# Udacity-Bike-share-project
My Udacity project that I have made to improve my skills for a Nano-Degree Udacity program

## Overview
### Introduction
This Python script is written for Project 2 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
